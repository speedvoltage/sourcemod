// DO NOT USE THIS FILE TO STORE BANNED NAMES. USE banned_names.ini INSTEAD.
//
// READ THIS FILE CAREFULLY, AS IT EXPLAINS HOW TO USE IT AND HOW BANNED NAMES ARE STORED.
//
// To add a name, simply type the name you want to have banned. YOU MUST ADD A NEW BLANK LINE AFTER THE LAST NAME! NAMES CANNOT HAVE WHITE SPACES!
// Banned names will be read on server restart, next map or by manually reloading files through sm_name_refresh. 
//
// A banned name means that if the banned word is found anywhere in somebody's player name, the entire name gets removed (or the player is kicked) i.e. if you ban the name "Apple", if a player is named "Apple is the best fruit", the entire name will be removed (or the player will be kicked). Be careful with the names you ban as this could quickly lead to undesired effects.
